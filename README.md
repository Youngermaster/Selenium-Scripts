# Selenium-Scripts

This repo contains some Selenium scripts I'm using to learn Selenium

## Setup

Make sure to install the following packages:

```
pip install selenium
pip install python-dotenv
```

**Note:** If you are using MacOs or Linux, maybe you should use `pip3` instead of `pip`.

## Examples

### EAFIT_daily_health_report.py

To be able to run the `EAFIT_daily_health_report.py` script you have create a `.env` file that looks
like this:

```
EMAIL=email@email.com
PASSWORD=1234567890
```
